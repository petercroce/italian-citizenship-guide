This guide is intended to make it a lot easier to get Italian citizenship by ancestry.

It contains questions to determine eligibility and a step-by-step guide.

## Upcoming Features
Contributions welcome!

1. Simple blog to post stories about the process of attaining citizenship. Stuff like:
- How do you get Italian birth records, death records, and marriage records from small villages in Sicily?
- How do you get certified letters of no record of naturalization from the USCIS? From the National Archives? From the archives of a small county in Louisiana where your great-grandfather lived in the early 1900s?
- How do you get apostilles? What is an apostille and why does it matter?
- How do you get vital records in other countries? So far, my experiences of obtaining and certifying vital records are only US- and Italy-based.
- How do you get an appointment at an Italian consulate to apply for Italian citizenship? What will you need to bring?
- How long does it take to obtain all those records?
- How long after applying does it take to receive your official Italian citizenship?
- After receiving Italian citizenship, how do you get an Italian passport?
- How much does the whole process cost?

2. Account registration, login, and persistance of eligibility results.
- This will use Firebase. If you want to work on this PR, I'll send you the credentials.
