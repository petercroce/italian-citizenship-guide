        <h1>How To Get Italian Citizenship</h1>
        <p>Most people with Italian ancestors can get Italian dual citizenship and an Italian passport, along with all the benefits of European citizenship such as the rights to live, work, establish business, and study in any of the 31 countries in the European Economic Area. The process is achievable but marred by misinformation and bureaucratic bloat.  </p>
        <p>After I received Italian dual citizenship and an Italian passport in 2018 (a process I began in 2014 and which required thousands of hours of research, paperwork, phonecalls, etc.), I decided to make an Italian citizenship guide â€” something I hope will be actually useful, something better than the hundreds of outdated blogs and websites I had to wade through.</p>
